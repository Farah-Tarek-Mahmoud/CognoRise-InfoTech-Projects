Data Science Projects Repository (CognoRise InfoTech Projects)
Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository. This repository showcases three significant projects Iâ€™ve worked on as part of my journey as a Data Scientist. Each project addresses different areas of machine learning and data analysis, utilizing various techniques to deliver insightful solutions.
These projects were completed as part of my professional experience at CognoRise InfoTech and my broader work in tech.

2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project dealt with an imbalanced dataset, where the goal was to accurately classify fraudulent credit card transactions. Given the class imbalance (492 fraud cases out of 284,315 transactions), addressing the imbalance was a crucial part of the workflow.

Key Steps:
Data Exploration: Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand transaction patterns and identify potential fraud indicators.
Data Preprocessing: Removed unnecessary columns and applied normalization techniques to bring all features onto the same scale.
Balancing the Data: Implemented oversampling (using SMOTE) and undersampling techniques to address the skewed class distribution.
Modeling: Applied various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Outcome: Achieved significant improvement in the detection of fraudulent transactions by focusing on model tuning and the use of proper metrics (precision-recall curve, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC-AUc) tailored to imbalanced datasets.

Feel free to explore the repository to see the code and datasets used for each project. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
