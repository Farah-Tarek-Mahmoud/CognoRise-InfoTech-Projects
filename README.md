Data Science Projects Repository (CognoRise InfoTech Projects)
Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository. This repository showcases three significant projects Iâ€™ve worked on as part of my journey as a Data Scientist. Each project addresses different areas of machine learning and data analysis, utilizing various techniques to deliver insightful solutions.
These projects were completed as part of my professional experience at CognoRise InfoTech and my broader work in tech.

Project Included:

3. Titanic Survival Prediction
The Titanic dataset project focused on predicting the survival of passengers based on multiple features such as age, gender, passenger class, etc. The goal was to identify the key factors influencing survival rates using machine learning models.

Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Conducted thorough data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection to enhance model accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Created new features (e.g., family size, encoded passenger class, Title) to provide better inputs for the models.
Modeling Techniques: Utilized both Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers, employing cross-validation with StratifiedKFold to ensure robustness.
Handling Class Imbalance: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance.
Model Evaluation: Compared model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.
The result was a well-performing model, demonstrating the importance of class and gender in survival prediction.

Feel free to explore the repository to see the code and datasets used for each project. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
